## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 2

A fundamental guideline of Fundamentals I, II, and OOD is to design
methods and functions systematically, starting with a signature, a
clear purpose statement (possibly illustrated with examples), and
unit tests.

Under each of the following elements below, indicate below where your
TAs can find:

- the data description of tiles, including an interpretation:

    <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/purmela/blob/35d3a5c30942c2443d2bbd47d2800a38c4fc770c/Fish/Common/tile.py#L3>

- the data description of boards, include an interpretation:

    <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/purmela/blob/35d3a5c30942c2443d2bbd47d2800a38c4fc770c/Fish/Common/board.py#L3>

- the functionality for removing a tile:
  - purpose:

    <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/purmela/blob/35d3a5c30942c2443d2bbd47d2800a38c4fc770c/Fish/Common/board.py#L138>

  - signature:

    <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/purmela/blob/35d3a5c30942c2443d2bbd47d2800a38c4fc770c/Fish/Common/board.py#L137>

  - unit tests:

      <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/purmela/blob/35d3a5c30942c2443d2bbd47d2800a38c4fc770c/Fish/Common/Test/test_board.py#L21>

- the functiinality for reaching other tiles on the board:
  - purpose:

    <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/purmela/blob/35d3a5c30942c2443d2bbd47d2800a38c4fc770c/Fish/Common/board.py#L50>

  - signature:

    <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/purmela/blob/35d3a5c30942c2443d2bbd47d2800a38c4fc770c/Fish/Common/board.py#L49>

  - unit tests:

    <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/purmela/blob/35d3a5c30942c2443d2bbd47d2800a38c4fc770c/Fish/Common/Test/test_board.py#L44>

The ideal feedback is a GitHub perma-link to the range of lines in specific
file or a collection of files for each of the above bullet points.

  WARNING: all such links must point to your commit "35d3a5c30942c2443d2bbd47d2800a38c4fc770c".
  Any bad links will result in a zero score for this self-evaluation.
  Here is an example link:
    <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/purmela/tree/35d3a5c30942c2443d2bbd47d2800a38c4fc770c/Fish>

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

In either case you may wish to, beneath each snippet of code you
indicate, add a line or two of commentary that explains how you think
the specified code snippets answers the request.
