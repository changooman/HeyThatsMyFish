- the data definition, including interpretation, of penguin movements for turns

<https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/purmela/blob/fd3dd46deb24be73031580be141bf7319ce05cd0/Fish/Common/Player/strategy.py#L112-L118>

- the unit tests for the penguin placement strategy

<https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/purmela/blob/fd3dd46deb24be73031580be141bf7319ce05cd0/Fish/Common/Player/Other/Test/test_strategy.py#L16-L46>

- the unit tests for the penguin movement strategy;
  given that the exploration depth is a parameter `N`, there should be at least two unit tests for different depths

<https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/purmela/blob/fd3dd46deb24be73031580be141bf7319ce05cd0/Fish/Common/Player/Other/Test/test_strategy.py#L49-L229>

- any game-tree functionality you had to add to create the `xtest` test harness:
  - where the functionality is defined in `game-tree.PP`
  - where the functionality is used in `xtree`
  - you may wish to submit a `git-diff` for `game-tree` and any auxiliary modules
