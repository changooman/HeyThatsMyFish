## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 1

### General 

We will run self-evaluations for each milestone this semester.  The
graders will evaluate them for accuracy and completeness.

Every self-evaluation will go out into your Enterprise GitHub repo
within a short time after the milestone deadline, and you will have 24
hours to answer the questions and push back a completed form.

This one is a practice run to make sure you get


### Specifics 


- does your analysis cover the following ideas:

  - the need for an explicit Interface specification between the (remote) AI 
    players and the game system?
        We will admit that we thought about this a little too low level and don't have the specifics of this planned. However, we do have a Connect TCP planned that we used to indicate the creation of multiplayer capabilities. Because the system.pdf file needed to be less than a page long we would have had trouble fitting higher level concepts into the file.


  - the need for a referee sub-system for managing individual games
        We did have a referee sub-system that would manage if the game was finished, as well as follow the rules of the game. we had multiple lines for this (we probably could have cut it down and added more multiplayer information.) our 'Remaining Moves' 'Move To' and 'Game Status' would act as the referee.


  - the need for a tournament management sub-system for grouping
    players into games and dispatching to referee components
        Once again, we gave a low-level description of the multiplayer capabilities focusing on the game itself rather than the networking and didn't have a specific answer for tournament management.


- does your building plan identify concrete milestones with demo prototypes:

  - for running individual games
        We did have multiple milestones to show the individual game running.



  - for running complete tournaments on a single computer 
        We had our second to last milestone be the complete game without online capabilities



  - for running remote tournaments on a network
        Our final milestone was for the complete game with online capabilities as well as profiles users can log onto.




- for the English of your memo, you may wish to check the following:

  - is each paragraph dedicated to a single topic? does it come with a
    thesis statement that specifies the topic?
	Our memos are organized into paragraphs that address a separate topic each. In the system memo specifically, each component paragraph had a purpose statement. In the milestones memo, it included a thesis of the goal of each milestone. 



  - do sentences make a point? do they run on?
	The sentences in our memo make a clear and concise point without running on. 



  - do sentences connect via old words/new words so that readers keep
    reading?
	The sentences in our memo connect words in a professional but interesting manner.



  - are all sentences complete? Are they missing verbs? Objects? Other
    essential words?
	The sentences in our memos are complete sentences. They are not missing verbs or any essential part of a complete sentence. 


  - did you make sure that the spelling is correct? ("It's" is *not* a
    possessive; it's short for "it is". "There" is different from
    "their", a word that is too popular for your generation.)
	The memos were run through spellchecks and do not have spelling errors. 


The ideal feedback are pointers to specific sentences in your memo.
For PDF, the paragraph/sentence number suffices. 

For **code repos**, we will expect GitHub line-specific links.
