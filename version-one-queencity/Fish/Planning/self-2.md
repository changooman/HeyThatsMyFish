## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 2

A fundamental guideline of Fundamentals I, II, and OOD is to design
methods and functions systematically, starting with a signature, a
clear purpose statement (possibly illustrated with examples), and
unit tests.

Under each of the following elements below, indicate below where your
TAs can find:

- the data description of tiles, including an interpretation:
https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/queencity/blob/2eafa8eef4201c31b900bc01212dcf646aea0cc1/Fish/Common/fish.py#L5-L33

- the data description of boards, include an interpretation:
https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/queencity/blob/2eafa8eef4201c31b900bc01212dcf646aea0cc1/Fish/Common/fish.py#L58-L78

- the functionality for removing a tile:
  - purpose: https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/queencity/blob/2eafa8eef4201c31b900bc01212dcf646aea0cc1/Fish/Common/fish.py#L214
 
  - signature: https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/queencity/blob/2eafa8eef4201c31b900bc01212dcf646aea0cc1/Fish/Common/fish.py#L215

  
  - unit tests: N/A 

- the functionality for reaching other tiles on the board:
  - purpose: https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/queencity/blob/2eafa8eef4201c31b900bc01212dcf646aea0cc1/Fish/Common/fish.py#L309

  - signature: https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/queencity/blob/2eafa8eef4201c31b900bc01212dcf646aea0cc1/Fish/Common/fish.py#L310-L311
 
  - unit tests:
https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/queencity/blob/2eafa8eef4201c31b900bc01212dcf646aea0cc1/Fish/Common/tester.py#L5-L76


The ideal feedback is a GitHub perma-link to the range of lines in specific
file or a collection of files for each of the above bullet points.

  WARNING: all such links must point to your commit "2eafa8eef4201c31b900bc01212dcf646aea0cc1".
  Any bad links will result in a zero score for this self-evaluation.
  Here is an example link:
    <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/queencity/tree/2eafa8eef4201c31b900bc01212dcf646aea0cc1/Fish>

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

In either case you may wish to, beneath each snippet of code you
indicate, add a line or two of commentary that explains how you think
the specified code snippets answers the request.
