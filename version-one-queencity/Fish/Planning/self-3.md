The ideal feedback is a GitHub perma-link to the range of lines in specific

  Any bad links will result in a zero score for this self-evaluation.

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

In either case you may wish to, beneath each snippet of code you
indicate, add a line or two of commentary that explains how you think
the specified code snippets answers the request.
