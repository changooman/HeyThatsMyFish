 This repo contains a digital version of the beloved board game, "Hey, That's My Fish!", and was coded in Python for CS4500 Software Development.

* The first version, queencity, was coded by Anne Wesley and myself
* The second version, newdiana, was the result of a classwide codebase switch where I was partnered up with Harrison Gieraltowski and his version of "Hey, That's My Fish!"
* The third version, tehuacana, was the result of another classwide codebase switch where I was partnered up with Matthew Gries and we took over a completely unfamiliar codebase
